Decorator - it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
We can define a decorator as a class in order to do that, we have to use a __call__ method of classes. When a user needs to create an object that acts as a function then function decorator needs to return an object that acts like a function, so __call__ can be useful

Exercise

remove the contructor from the child class
